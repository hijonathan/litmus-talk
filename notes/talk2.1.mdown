So what do we get when we unshackle ourselves from Outlook?


# The Tools to Stand Out

Staying relevant in the inbox will always be tough. Thankfully, you now have a whole new set of tools to help you make a strong impression. And people really care.

So let's talk about a couple of those.

### [Animations](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css)

Animations are particularly cool when done right. More people are starting to open email in mobile, and it's going to be even more difficult to stand out. A subtle transition/animation can go a long way to making a strong impression.

### [Drawings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/pure-css3-homer/launch)

Ros and Justine have written about cool image fallbacks using background colors and alt text styling. But sometimes you just absolutely want your image shown.

You can either use an image to HTML converter like [this one](https://github.com/HubSpot/img2html), or you can draw the image in CSS.

Another simple alternative is to embed an SVG image. Simply export your image to SVG format and open it in your favorite text editor to get the underlying code. Then simply copy/paste that into your email.

### [Fancy hover/click state](http://www.zurb.com/playground/css-boxshadow-experiments)

In email, we usually think of _clicks_ as a way to take people to the web. But on the web, there are plenty of other reasons to click. Perhaps you want to expand something, or maybe you just want something to make you smile.

With some CSS, you can take advantage of the :hover or :visited state of elements on the page.


# The Power to Engage

> "I love getting unstyled, impersonal marketing emails that I can share with all my friends and colleagues." - No one, ever

How many times have you received a truly spectular email? One that you just had to share with your friends? Keeping someone engaged with your email, even when the content is great, is very difficult to do.

Instead of trying to bombard people with information, we can instead attempt to make a personal connection and set the right tone with a video.

### Rich Media

This has been something long sought-after. People have done some pretty sweet workarounds with animated gifs and fancy CSS. But since we're designing for mobile, we can take full advantage of `<video>` and `<audio>` tags.

[Audio in email](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/3890/adding-audio-to-email-newsletters)

The support for these is actually pretty startling. There are a number of fallbacks, and you can even drop all the way down to just showing an image. I'm certain there's more innovation to be made here.


# The Ability to Convert

This happens to me all the time: in the middle of my commute, I'll get an email that asks me a question.

> "Acknowledge or escalate?" - Rodan alert service

> "Want to read more?" - Wistia Video Snack Email

> "Add to cart?" - Amazon Local Deals

I'm interested in these emails, but I'm also busy at the moment: I'm trying to get through my email, so I'll inevitably have to come back to these emails at a later time, definitely when I'm not on my phone.

For marketers and email designers, that's a missed opportunity. Let's fix that.

### Hover is the New Click

Hover events on the web are actually triggered by click events in mobile. This means that you can use the CSS pseudo selector `:hover` to style things differently when clicked.

### Sibling Selectors

The `:hover` pseudo selector is great when you want to style the clicked element, but what if you want to style some other element?

An oft overlooked detail in CSS is the sibling selector. With it, you can get stuff next to an element. Combine that with the `:hover` selector, and you now have click-control of adjacent elements.

### Jumping the Shark with Checkboxes

If that's not cool enough, you can style things beyond just the adjacent by using `<label>` and `<input>` tags.

### SVG

The above techniques are great for doing simple collapse/expand patterns, in-page navigation and the like. If you want to get more advanced, you can also try your hand at using SVG and SMIL events.
